    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Deep under the sea at the Krusty Krab, one burger reigns supreme: 
        the legendary Krabby Patty. While Mr. Krabs keeps the secret 
        formula under lock and key, we suspect it might involve a beachy 
        classic like the Chesapeake region’s Old Bay seasoning. Potatorolls.com's Old 
        Bay Burger, served on Martin’s Big Marty’s Rolls and stacked with 
        all the fixings, is a pretty solid guess—and a delicious one at that. 
        And if that doesn’t quite satisfy your seafood craving, try our Crab Cake 
        Sliders for a tasty twist. Just… don’t tell Mr. Krabs. 
        This recipe serves 6 people.</p>
