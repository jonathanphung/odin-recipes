    <p>Popeye didn’t need much to save the day—just a can 
        of <strong>spinach</strong> and a little muscle. This classic 
        cartoon moment turned leafy greens into a symbol 
        of <em>strength</em>, and now you can enjoy them in a far 
        tastier form. Potatorolls.com's Salami and Spinach 
        Scramble on 
        Toast combines tender sautéed spinach and onions,

        served alongside toasted Martin’s Potato Bread. 
        It’s a hearty, power-packed breakfast that’ll 
        have you feeling strong to the finish. This recipe
        serves between 4-6 people.</p>
