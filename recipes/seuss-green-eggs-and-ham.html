    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dr. Seuss’s Green Eggs and Ham has inspired 
        generations of readers to try something new—and
         now, you can taste this <em>whimsical</em> classic for 
         yourself. Potatorolls.com's Green Eggs & Ham 
         Sandwich brings 
         the book to life using assorted Martin’s breads, 
         scrambled eggs blended with pesto for that 
         signature green hue, sliced deli ham, and 
         provolone cheese.  Toast the bread into creative 
         shapes for extra fun, or enjoy as-is for a quirky 
         breakfast or lunch that <strong>Sam-I-Am</strong> would absolutely 
         approve of. This recipe serves 3 people.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 Slices Assorted Martin's Bread</li>
        <li>4 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Fat-Free Milk</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Prepared Pesto</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Butter</li>
        <li>3 Slices Deli Ham</li>
        <li>3 Slices Provolone Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast 2 slices each of Martin's Potato Bread, Martin's 
            100% Whole Wheat Potato Bread, and Martin's Old-Fashioned
            Real Butter Bread.
        </li>
        <li>Using a shamrock-shaped cookie cutter, cut each bread slice into
            a shamrock shape.
        </li>
        <li>Crack 4 eggs into a medium bowl. Add 3 tablespoons prepared pesto
            and 1/4 cup milk. Whisk to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium 
            heat. Add egg mixture to warm skillet.
        </li>
        <li>Allow eggs to set until they are fully cooked, flipping to the other
            side if necessary, being careful not to break them apart. When the eggs
            are fully set, remove from skillet and cut into thirds.
        </li>
        <li>Layer ham, eggs, and cheese on 1 slice of each type of toast. Top with the
            second slice.
