# odin-recipes
This is a project created to demonstrate my abilities in HTML. It follows TheOdinProject curriculum. 

Hopefully, by the end of the project, I have used:
- links (anchor tags, href, target)
- images (width, height, alt)
- bold (strong tags)
- italics (emphasis tags)
- entities (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;)
- images 

Reflection:

Completely forgot to use entities (oops), but everything else was used! Noreferrer and noopener attributes were used in links citing the original recipe's website.
